Problem 12. Development Environments
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Perform a research (e.g. in Google or Wikipedia) and provide a short list with popular development environments (IDEs) like 
Visual Studio.Write in a text file called “list-of-IDEs.txt” at least five IDEs along with 2-3 sentences about each of them. 
Use English.


1. Microsoft Visual Studio

  Microsoft Visual Studio is an integrated development environment (IDE) from Microsoft. It is used to develop computer 
  programs for Microsoft Windows, as well as web sites, web applications and web services. Visual Studio uses Microsoft 
  software development platforms such as Windows API, Windows Forms, Windows Presentation Foundation, Windows Store and 
  Microsoft Silverlight. It can produce both native code and managed code.Visual Studio supports different programming 
  languages and allows the code editor and debugger to support (to varying degrees) nearly any programming language, provided
  a language-specific service exists. Built-in languages include C, C++ and C++/CLI (via Visual C++), VB.NET (via Visual Basic
  .NET), C# (via Visual C#), and F# (as of Visual Studio 2010). Support for other languages such as M, Python, and Ruby among
  others is available via language services installed separately. It also supports XML/XSLT, HTML/XHTML, JavaScript and CSS.


2. Eclipse

  Eclipse is an integrated development environment (IDE). It contains a base workspace and an extensible plug-in system for 
  customizing the environment. Written mostly in Java, Eclipse can be used to develop applications. By means of various plug-
  ins, Eclipse may also be used to develop applications in other programming languages: Ada, ABAP, C, C++, COBOL, Fortran, 
  Haskell, JavaScript, Lasso, Natural, Perl, PHP, Prolog, Python, R, Ruby (including Ruby on Rails framework), Scala, Clojure,
  Groovy, Scheme, and Erlang. It can also be used to develop packages for the software Mathematica. Development environments 
  include the Eclipse Java development tools (JDT) for Java and Scala, Eclipse CDT for C/C++ and Eclipse PDT for PHP, among 
  others.


3. Netbeans 

  NetBeans is an integrated development environment (IDE) for developing primarily with Java, but also with other languages,
  in particular PHP, C/C++, and HTML5.It is also an application platform framework for Java desktop applications and others.
  The NetBeans IDE is written in Java and can run on Windows, OS X, Linux, Solaris and other platforms supporting a compatible
  JVM.The NetBeans Platform allows applications to be developed from a set of modular software components called modules. 
  Applications based on the NetBeans Platform (including the NetBeans IDE itself) can be extended by third party developers.


4. Mono

  Mono is a free and open source project led by Xamarin to create an Ecma standard-compliant, .NET Framework-compatible set of
  tools including, among others, a C# compiler and a Common Language Runtime.The stated purpose of Mono is not only to be able
  to run Microsoft .NET applications cross-platform, but also to bring better development tools to Linux developers. Mono can 
  be run on many software systems including Android, most Linux distributions, BSD, OS X, Windows, Solaris, and even some game
  consoles such as PlayStation 3, Wii, and Xbox 360.It supports Boo, C, C++, C#, CIL, D, F#, Java, Oxygene, Python, Vala, and
  Visual Basic.NET.


5. Code::Blocks

  Code::Blocks is a free C, C++ and Fortran IDE built to meet the most demanding needs of its users.It is designed to be very
  extensible and fully configurable, supporting different platforms.Built around a plugin framework, Code::Blocks can be 
  extended with plugins.Any kind of functionality can be added by installing/coding a plugin.
