    .NET Framework is a software framework developed by Microsoft that runs primarily on Microsoft Windows.It includes a large
  class library known as Framework Class Library (FCL) and provides language interoperability (each language can use code written
  in other languages) across several programming languages. Programs written for .NET Framework execute in a software environment
  (as contrasted to hardware environment), known as Common Language Runtime (CLR), an application virtual machine that provides
  services such as security, memory management, and exception handling. FCL and CLR together constitute .NET Framework.
    On the other hand C# is just one of the languages supported by .NET Framework. It was developed by Microsoft within it's
  .NET initiative and it's one of the programming languages designed for the Common Language Infrastructure.
